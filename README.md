This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a basic calculator that performs mathematical operations. The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and other functions like clear and equals. Users can input numbers and operators using the buttons, and the calculator displays the result on the screen.
Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:
 * Number Input: Clicking on number buttons (1-9 and 0) adds the corresponding number to the input field.
 * Operator Input: Clicking on operator buttons (+, -, *, /) adds the chosen operator to the input field.
 * Clear Function: Clicking the "CL" button clears the input field.
 * Equals Function: Clicking the "=" button sends the expression in the input field to a server-side script for evaluation using the fetch API. The result is then displayed back in the input field.
 * Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for non-numeric characters being entered through the keyboard and for potential errors from the server-side script.
Code Breakdown
The code consists of three parts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML:
 * The HTML structure defines the layout of the calculator, including the input field, buttons, and overall calculator div.
CSS:
 * The CSS styles the calculator's appearance, such as the background color, button sizes, and font styles.
JavaScript:
 * The JavaScript code controls the calculator's interactivity. It includes:
   * Event listeners for button clicks and keyboard presses.
   * Functionality to update the input field based on user interactions.
   * A function (calculate()) to send the expression to the server for evaluation and display the result.
   * A clear function (Clear()) to clear the input field.
   * Error handling for non-numeric characters and potential server errors.
Server-Side Script is included below 
The provided code assumes a server-side script running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/calculate that can receive a mathematical expression, evaluate it, and return the result. This script is not included in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code provided.
Overall, this code demonstrates the creation of a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a server-side component for calculation.
